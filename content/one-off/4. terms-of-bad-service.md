This came from a side conversation at work about websites' terms of service and how they are often skipped due to their length and complexity and (at least for the people I've asked) a lack of time to fully read it top to bottom in the time it took to sign up or use the service. This is a **satirical** attempt at solving only one of those problems: reading the full terms of service. This does not resolve the complexity or time problem.

## How this works

The system works by presenting your user with the terms of service one randomly-placed button at a time, each containing only one word of the terms (or message) you want them to read. When complete, the user is given a success message and the button to continue with registration (or whatever the next step is) is automatically enabled.
